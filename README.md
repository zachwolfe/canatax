estimate = IncomeTaxCalculator.calculate(income=80000, province="BC")

print(f"Province: {estimate.province}")
print(f"Federal Tax: ${estimate.federal_tax:,.2f}")
print(f"Provincial Tax: ${estimate.provincial_tax:,.2f}")
print(f"CPP: ${estimate.cpp:,.2f}")

print(f"After-Tax Income: ${estimate.after_tax_income:,.2f}")
```
